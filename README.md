## Description
This is a simple calendar application that allows for users to schedule their standard workday. 
It has a save button to save whatever the user inputs to the site's local storage.

## Technologies
The languages I used for this assignment are HTML, CSS, Javascript mixed in with Jquery. 
I consistently used my browser to try and adjust the CSS at different media queries and just decided on the simplest layout that works well with the appropriate content.

## Challenges
Some challenges I faced while producing this app were that it was very confusing on adjusting the CSS so that the browser looked good with some of the Jquery elements.
But overall, this assignment was pretty simple once I figured out how Moment.js worked and able to implement so many different things.
I learned a lot more about JQuery and using third-party APIs like Moment.js so that my browser can follow the time of my time zone.
